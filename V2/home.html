    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>Im Fiku_. I'm just a guy that knows bits about computers n' that. I do some web development, and c# stuff, as
        well as some graphic design.</p>
    <p>Don't mind the website styling, its not done yet.</p>
    <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>I do some basic windows .net development with c#. Im no where near an expert, but I do it on the side when I
            have the time or if I have a niche problem, and can be fixed with some rough code.</p>
        <p>I also do some basic web dev stuff, largely on the front-end, because I'm still learning and JavaScript and
            never used things like PHP yet.</p>
        <p>Finally, I do some graphic design work on the side, largely for my own projects, but I can do some basic
            stuff for others if they ask nicely.</p>
    <h2>What I enjoy</h2>
        <p>I like learning new things, and at the moment I'm especially looking at things like networks and security,
            and back end web dev.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy gaming, and I play a variety of games, largely on PC. My main picks are Counter Strike 2, osu!
            and Minecraft.</p>
        <p>I love photography, it's one of my favourite practical hobbies to do. You can find some of my photos on my
            Instagram.</p>
        <p>Along with photography, i also enjoy video production. I did some work while in school for some promotional
            videos.</p>
